# CypressXSeleniumWebdriver
Automation testing project using Cypress and Selenium Webdriver on the [Evershop](https://github.com/evershopcommerce/evershop) e-commerce web application.

This project unveils different types of tests, including API and DB tests using Cypress and Selenium Webdriver using Mocha and Chai (ALL JAVASCRIPT).

# Steps to reproduce

1. Clone the project using the steps from Evershop's [installation](https://evershop.io/docs/development/getting-started/installation-guide) guide.
2. All packages for testing with Cypress, respectively Selenium Webdriver are already installed, so you can just make use of the available scripts from the _package.json_ file.
3. Make sure you understand the tests before running them (some leave modified data in the application and may produce errors the sacond time they are run).

# Some advice that will boost your learning for automation testing using these two tools

Learn how to:

- open Cypress application or run tests in the CLI
- use the driver to connect and navigate to a specific web page (Selenium)
- locate web elements in the DOM
- learn about Xpath and CSS selectors
- make a documentation and test cases (even better) than mine
- use Git in order to add your project to a GitHub repository
